# Student Performance Dashboard 📊

Hi! I'm Surbhi Singh.  
This is a small Python project I made to explore how data visualization can help in understanding student performance.

I’m sharing this as part of my application for the **LabMentix Internship**.

---

## 🔍 What this project does:

- It reads student data from a CSV file
- Calculates average marks in each subject
- Shows how attendance might be related to marks
- Uses simple graphs to make the data easy to understand

---

## 🛠️ Tools I used:

- Python
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for plotting charts)

---

## 🧩 Files in this repo:

- `student_performance_data.csv` → sample data of students  
- `subject_avg_plot.png` → graph of average marks per subject  
- `attendance_vs_avg_plot.png` → graph showing attendance vs marks  

---

## 💡 Why I made this:

I enjoy working with data and wanted to create something that can give real insights.  
This project helped me understand how important attendance and consistent performance is.  

It’s a simple project, but I learned a lot while doing it 😊

---

## ✨ About me:

I'm currently learning Python and exploring real-world use cases of data.  
This is one of my first data projects and I’m excited to learn more through this internship.

Thank you for checking out my work!
